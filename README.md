# Dynamic_Web_Apps_Final_Project
This repository will serve as the final project submission for my INST377 course at the University of Maryland

This Project is titled NASA EXOPLANET ARCHIVE STATISTICS. Its goal is to display some key statistics contained within the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=NASA+exoplanet+archive&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) dataset. As of now, there will be one primary visualiztion generated by Chart.js. The exact visualization has not yet been identified. 

The second part of the website will display 3 numerical staticis, which as of the writing of this Readme have not been explicity identified. 

The displayed data for this project do not go through any NASA API. Rather, they go through a website created by myself and Ethan Heugler, a computer science student at the University of Maryland. We collaborated on a project that I wrote the back-end for. In order to get data to Ethan, I created API endpoints using Python's Flask which generated appropriate JSON objects from a SQL database I set up. An example endpoint is avalibale at https://exo-dash-planets.vercel.app/api/vis/discovery_methods_bar
